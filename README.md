### Welcome
I'm a spatial scientist primarily writing in R. 

Creating rmd to generate summary documents is wonderful. It's my primary tool in attempting to answer the internal question of "How do you explain to the other group members what you are doing on the project with clarity and understanding". I'd like to think it works sometimes.

  A big thanks to the maintainers of and contributors to
  
**raster -- sp -- sf -- tmap -- plotly -- rmarkdown -- dplyr** 

I do my best to make good work of all your hard work about 5 days a week, minus meetings

I write things generally unrelated to programing [here](https://carverd.com). Often just writing to reflect.
