### Welcome
I'm a spatial scientist primarily writing in R. 

Creating rmd to generate summary documents is wonderful and I try to do that a lot

A big thanks to the maintainers and cotributors to 
**raster -- sp -- sf -- tmap -- ploty -- rmarkdown -- dplyr** 
I do my best to make good work of all your hard work about 5 days a week

### Currect projects include 
- Does [night light imagery](https://github.com/dcarver1/covidNightLights) tell us anything about the econmic impacts of COVID-19 in the USA?
- All those [results](https://dcarver1.github.io/cwrUSA_maps/) from the [publication](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/52/33351) found a life outside of the zip file

### I'm contributing to 
- How well are our[ wild plants conserved](https://github.com/CIAT-DAPA/GapAnalysis)? 

I write more and more about things entirely unrelated to programing [here](https://carverd.com).
